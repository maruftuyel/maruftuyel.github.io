<P>COMPILATION:This is the main step where the source code is translated into machine code. The compiler reads the source code files (.c, .cpp, .java, etc.) and translates them into object code (or intermediate bytecode in some cases). This object code is usually platform-specific and not directly executable.</P>
<p>WEB SECURITY:Web developers must consider security measures to protect websites and web applications from potential threats such as hacking, data breaches, and malware.
